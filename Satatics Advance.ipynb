    "Q1. What is the Probability Density Function (PDF)?\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a specific value. The area under the PDF curve between two points represents the probability that the variable falls within that range. The total area under the PDF curve equals 1.\n",

    "Q2. What are the types of Probability Distribution?\n",
    "The main types of probability distributions are:\n",
    "1.\tNormal Distribution: A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where the mean, median, and mode coincide.\n",
    "2.\tBinomial Distribution: Describes the number of successes in a fixed number of Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "3.\tPoisson Distribution: Describes the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space.\n",
    "4.\tUniform Distribution: All outcomes are equally likely within a certain range.\n",
    "5.\tExponential Distribution: Describes the time between events in a Poisson process.\n",

    "Q4. What are the properties of Binomial Distribution? Give two examples of events where binomial distribution can be applied.\n",
    "Properties of Binomial Distribution:\n",
    "1.\tFixed number of trials (n): The process consists of a fixed number of independent trials.\n",
    "2.\tTwo possible outcomes: Each trial has only two possible outcomes, success or failure.\n",
    "3.\tConstant probability of success (p): The probability of success is the same for every trial.\n",
    "4.\tIndependent trials: The outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of another.\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "1.\tFlipping a coin 10 times and counting the number of heads.\n",

    "The key differences are:\n",
    "•\tBinomial: Fixed number of trials, probability of success remains constant.\n",
